# exaQuark

exaQuark is a platform for Mixed Reality. 

We provide the tools and infrastructure for developers to build digital worlds that are exactly mapped to the physical world. This can be used for Augmented Reality social networks and games like Pokemon Go. 

exaQuark can scale to millions of people, existing in the same world. Participants can communicate with all their neighbors, no matter how big the world and how many people exist inside it.



### Metaverse

We are building the Metaverse. The Metaverse is a convergence of the physical world and digital worlds.   
The digital worlds are exactly mapped to the physical worldâ€™s latitude and longitude.

The Metaverse  of the future will contain millions of universes - each a creation of individuals, companies, or machines.
