# exaQuark

exaQuark is a platform for Mixed Reality.

We provide the tools and infrastructure for developers to build digital worlds that are exactly mapped to the physical world. This can be used for Augmented Reality social networks and games like Pokemon Go.

exaQuark can scale to millions of people, existing in the same world. Participants can communicate with all their neighbors, no matter how big the world and how many people exist inside it.

### Metaverse

We are building the Metaverse. The Metaverse is a convergence of the physical world and digital worlds.  
The digital worlds are exactly mapped to the physical world’s latitude and longitude.

The Metaverse of the future will contain millions of universes - each a creation of individuals, companies, or machines.

There’s no separation between universes - users playing Pokemon Go can see and interact with users in the World of Warcraft universe.

### Scaling the Metaverse

The Metaverse faces a fundamental problem: how do you build a singular, continuous world for 7 billion people, when most online games can’t scale past 10,000 users?

The team at exaQuark have over 30 years experience in development of large scale and distributed computing. We built the worlds first P2P virtual world and helped scale to SecondLife to millions of users.

We will handle the scaling, you just need to focus on the content.
