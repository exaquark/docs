# Neighbors and Neighborhoods

@todo: explanation of neighborhoods and Delaunay.

* Every neighbour returned with a `delaunay`
* Delaunay is a number 1-5
* 1 is your closest neighbours
* 5 is your furthest neighbours
* Neighborhoods are independent of distance. Your closest neighbour could be 1000km away from you
